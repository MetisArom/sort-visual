# Sort Visual - Gabriel Mora
### Project Intro
A program which visualizes different sorting algorithms for
organizing array of elements (probably numerical like ints or doubles)

### Project Goals:
* Develop visual component so that sort algorithm visualizes each step made as it orders array.
* Provide functionality for using different sorting algorithms.
* Provide functionality for users editing input array, size, etc, and visual sort speed.
* Provide sorting algorithm data such as big-O, name, runtime, actions, etc.

### Learning Goals:
* User Interface and visuals for the sorting algorithm and user edit tools.
* Learn about sorting algorithms such as bubble, merge, quicksort, etc.
